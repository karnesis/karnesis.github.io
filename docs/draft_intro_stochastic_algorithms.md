In all physics experiments, what we basically do is to record nature. We then need to compare the data we have measured with our own understanding of nature, i.e. our models. For some cases the model can be quite simple and easy to manipulate, for example, imagine [Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_experiment#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20story%2C%20Galileo,speed%20proportional%20to%20their%20mass).  We need a person on top of the tower to drop several spheres (made from dense material, such as iron) of different sizes, while we measure the time they need to hit the ground. If our time measuring device is a stopwatch which we hold in our hands, the simple Newtonian model will suffice for our purposes (assume the balls are massive enough that friction effects and weather contribute negligibly to our experiment). By repeating the experiment for spheres of various sizes, we can verify that their acceleration is independent to their mass.  

The same applies to much more complicated cases, such as measuring Gravitational Wave signals with our detectors. In this example, and for the time being*, the signals are much weaker. So weak, that sometimes they are just barely recorded with our detectors. Thus, we have to model, not only physics -the coalescing binaries that generate GWs-, but our detector capabilities as well. And our detector limitations are encapsulated in their noise properties. The noise in our detectors can originate from different environmental effects that "disturb" our science measurement, or even limitations of our equipment. For example, in our previous simple investigation of Galileo's experiment, our measurement limitations could arise from the clock accuracy, or small time differences when releasing the spheres from the top of the tower, or our own perception and response time when pressing the button of the stopwatch.

> In the near future, current detectors will be greatly enhanced, and at the same time, new machines will give us the opportunity to measure compact binaries with unprecedented accuracy.

For the case of more complicated physics experiments, we can get disturbances from all types of sources imaginable. They can originate from thermal fluctuations,  or magnetic fluctuations generated by the nearby electronics, brownian motion of free particles in our apparatus, seismic noise, light pollution, weather patterns, traffic, closing doors, the electrical grid instability, birds, insects, Dave eating loudly his burrito (for the millionth time Dave)... You name it.

The good news is that we can try to model those noise contributions, and then take those models into account when performing our analysis. The bad news is that we need to perform a million of calibration experiments in order to measure the underlying physical mechanisms that generate those noises. But I guess this is why there are thousands of people, physicists and engineers, working together in large collaborations. In the end, after all this work, we finally get to model the statistical properties of the measured noise of our instrument. If the noise has Gaussian properties, then it's quite easy to handle it. Statistically speaking. The Gaussian distribution, is no other than the renowned bell curve:

If our detector noise has Gaussian properties<abbr title="That is a big _if_. But thankfully, due to the Central Limit Theorem, in many cases this can be true!">$\ast$</abbr>, then that means that each new data point of the noise that we record is very probable to be found around a value $\mu$, with a probability that is perfectly described by the properties of the given bell curve. We can write this down as
$$\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{\!2}\,\right)$$.
