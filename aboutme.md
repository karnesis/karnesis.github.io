Welcome to my small corner of the internet. My name is Nikos, and I am fascinated by Gravitational Wave physics. In particular I am really interested in searching for Gravitational-Wave signals buried in the instrumental noise.

Right now I am located at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh), working on data analysis algorithms for the future ESA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission.

### My story

I began my studies at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), and in particular at the school of [Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences](http://semfe.ntua.gr/en/). From the start I was drawn to data analysis and in particular to stochastic algorithms for parameter estimation. I had the chance to utilize my skills during my PhD at the [Institut d'Estudis Espacials de Catalunya](http://www.ieec.cat/en/home), where I worked on the preparation of the data analysis for the ESA LISA [Pathfinder mission](https://sci.esa.int/web/lisa-pathfinder) (LPF). During my first post-doc at the [AEI-Hannover](https://www.aei.mpg.de/), I had the privilege of participating in the mission operations, by analyzing real-time data, and designing experiments to be performed on-board the satellite. Following the astounding success of LPF, and during my time at the [APC](http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/APC_CS/) in Paris, I turned to the future space-based Gravitational-Wave observatory, the ESA [LISA mission](https://sci.esa.int/web/lisa). Since then, I have been focusing on simulation, data analysis, and the characterization of stochastic Gravitational-Wave signals with LISA. Currently, I am based at the AUTh, where I am developing a prototype data analysis pipelines for the mission, funded by the ESA [Prodex program](https://sci.esa.int/web/prodex/-/59648-programme-introduction), the [Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation](https://www.elidek.gr/en/homepage/), and the [MSCA](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) programme. I am a member of the [Hellenic Astronomical Society](https://helas.gr/), and I was recently elected as a member of the governing board of the [Hellenic Society on Relativity, Gravitation and Cosmology](http://www.hsrgc.gr/). In 2023 I was invited to join the Fundamental Physics Panel of the European Space Sciences Committee ([ESSC](https://www.essc.esf.org/)), and in 2024 I was selected by ESA to join the LISA Science Team ([LST](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/lisa/lisa-science-team)). The LST is the body of experts that provides scientific advice during the development and operations of the LISA mission.
